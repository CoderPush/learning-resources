Nicole discusses a systematic debugging process, which is applicable to various systems. The process involves:
- Understanding the symptoms
- Reproducing the bug
- Grasping the system
- Forming a bug location hypothesis
- Testing it
- Fixing the bug

Key questions include when the bug started, how often it occurs, and what has changed. Reproducing the bug is crucial. Understanding the system helps connect the dots. Testing the hypothesis is nuanced and thorough. Fixing comes last after comprehensive understanding.
