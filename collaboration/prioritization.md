- Building a prioritization framework (https://leaddev.com/process/building-prioritization-framework)

Saimon provides frameworks to help engineering managers effectively prioritize projects for their teams. 
It emphasizes the importance of setting the stage by building credibility and intuition. 
Three recommended frameworks are discussed - the Eisenhower Matrix, Rocks Pebbles Sand, and RICE. 
Whichever is chosen, expectations must be set and managed as prioritization can feel uncomfortable. 
Effective prioritization involves doing preparatory work, selecting a pragmatic framework, and handling expectations. 
The frameworks can help determine what is most important and urgent to focus on first each quarter. 
Overall, prioritization is a skill that benefits from experience and aligning stakeholders.
