## HTTP Requests

Understanding the fundamentals of HTTP requests is crucial for web engineers.

    What happens behind the scenes when we type google.com in a browser?

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a key language for web engineers, allowing them to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Engineers must have a solid understanding of the language, including its syntax, data types, and how it handles asynchronous code.

    Philip Roberts, Staff Software Engineer, GitHub

    One JavaScript developer's journey towards understanding how the JavaScript call stack, event loop, callback queue, render queue and web APIs all interact.

## React

React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. Engineers must be proficient in using React's components, state management, and lifecycle methods.

* [React Best Practices with Kent Dodds](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2020/03/06/react-best-practices-with-kent-dodds/)
    Kent Dodds, JavaScript Engineer, PayPal

    This episode of Software Engineering Daily discusses the growth of React, notable changes since its initial release, caveats for using Redux, improving application performance, testing, and JavaScript fatigue.
* [Drawing the Invisible: How to Explain React through Visual Metaphors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8MF3aDg-bM&feature=youtu.be&t=13845)
    Maggie Appleton, Art Director & Lead Illustrator, egghead.io

    Maggie explains React through visual metaphors: how React sits between the backend and the DOM, how JSX is an extension of vanilla JS, how components can be reused by providing different props, and how data and events flow through React's tree structure.

## Application State

Managing application state is an essential challenge for engineers. They must be able to store and update data across different components and pages of a web application. They should also be familiar with different state management libraries.

* [Avoiding Accidental Complexity When Structuring Your App State](https://hackernoon.com/avoiding-accidental-complexity-when-structuring-your-app-state-6e6d22ad5e2a)
    Tal Kol, Co Founder, Orbs

    Tal provides a list of practical tips of how to model app state: avoid modeling state after the server API, prefer maps to arrays, avoid modeling state after what views like to consume, never hold duplicate data in the app state, never store derived data in the state, normalize nested objects, and view app state as an in-memory database.

## Authentication

Web engineers must be proficient in implementing secure authentication systems to protect user data. They should be familiar with different authentication methods, including JWT and OAuth, and be able to integrate them into their web applications. Engineers should also be aware of common security vulnerabilities and best practices for securing web applications.

* [Authentication in React Applications](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/authentication-in-react-applications)
    Kent Dodds, JavaScript Engineer, PayPal

    Kent walks through code samples for how to organize a React app with both unauthenticated and authenticated views.
